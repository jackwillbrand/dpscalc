# dpscalc
To build the project, you should just be able to run `.\configure_build.py`, which will create
all of the necessary build files in the `build/` directory along build a `dpscalc.exe` file, 
which can be executed to launch the project. Requirements for the project are:

- Python (for the ./configure_build.py project, technically isn't necessary if you want to do it 
manually) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- MinGW (for make and building the code) (https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
- CMake (for generating the build files) (https://cmake.org/download/)
